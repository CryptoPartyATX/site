		<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong> CryptoParty ATX is a non-partisan organization dedicated to providing a fun, social environment to educate the public about how encryption can protect our digital privacy rights. Anyone is welcome to attend our events or contribute in any way, and all CryptoParties are free.</p>

		<p><strong>What We Do:</strong> We host free parties open to the general public where we teach basic to advanced cryptography skills. We want to make crypto accessible to as many people as possible, so we always aim to provide at least one topic at the beginner level. We encourage people of all computer skill levels to attend and learn, help others learn, or respectfully contribute to the social atmosphere.</p>
          
		<p><strong>What We Don't Do:</strong> We don't exclude anyone willing to learn. We don't harass anyone for any reason. We don't discriminate for any reason. We don't break any laws.</p>
