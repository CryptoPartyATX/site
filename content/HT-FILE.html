       <h1>File and Folder Encryption with GPG</h1>
          <h3><i>A guide to encrypting files with GPG</i></h3>
          <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This guide attempts to explain how to use GPG to encrypt files instead of (or in addition to) using TrueCrypt.</p>

          <p><strong>Software:</strong> The only software needed is the GPG application for your OS:</p>

          <h2>Nutshell</h2>
          <p><ol>
			<li>First, we are going to talk about how this works, and why we no longer use TrueCrypt.</li>
			<li>Second, we will explain the command and encrypt a file.</li>
			<li>Third, we will test our encrypted file by decrypting it.</li>
			<li>Last, we will discuss practical uses for this method.</li>
		  </ol></p>
		  
          <h2>Part I: GPG - How and why?</h2>
          <p>GPG works by using a public and private key to encrypt and decrypt files. This is particularly useful when sending files to someone else. If you encrypt the file with your contact's public key before sending it, only your contact will be able to open it (as long as they are the only person with the paired private key). If you encrypt a file with your own public key, only you will be able to decrypt it. You can optionally use a single password to encrypt and decrypt a file, but this offers less protection.</p>
          <p>Please keep in mind that GPG makes an encrypted copy of the original file. This means the original unencrypted file will still be there. Be sure to securely delete this original if you do not want to store an unencrypted copy.</p>
          <p>A notice was posted on <a target="_blank" href="http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/">TrueCrypt's main webpage</a> stating that TrueCrypt is not secure and development has ceased. While this information has not been officially confirmed at this time, we recommend using GPG to encrypt your TrueCrypt volumes at least until the matter is resolved. You can use GPG in combination with TrueCrypt volumes, or you can encrypt your files with GPG alone. We recommend using GPG for sensitive files rather than relying solely on closed-source software like BitLocker.</p>

          <p><strong>If you do not have GPG installed, please see Part II of <a href="?page=1.1<?php echo $extraparams; ?>">our Email Encryption tutorial</a>.</strong><br> Be sure to create your own public/private key pair in order to use the signing and recipient features.</p>
		<ol><h3>Option 1: Context Menu</h3>

			<li>Check the box next to the recipient(s) who should be allowed to decrypt it. (You might just want to choose yourself.)</li>
			<li>The <span class="clickItem">Secret Key</span> line will allow you to sign the file to show it hasn't changed and/or add yourself as someone who can decrypt it.

            <h3>Option 2: Command Line</h3>

            <li>Double-click <span class="clickItem">Terminal</span> in your <span class="clickItem">Applications</span> folder.</li>
            <li>The following basic command is used to encrypt a file with GPG:<br>

          	The program will only decrypt the file if the correct private key is in your keyring. If it is, you will be asked for the passphrase to decrypt the file. Here is an example of what I might run:<br>
          		<strong>Decrypt <em>secrets.txt.pgp</em> (from the previous example):</strong><br>
				<div class="code">gpg -d secrets.txt.pgp &gt; secrets.txt</div><br>

          <h2>Part IV: Possible Uses</h2>
          	<h3>Transition TrueCrypt files</h3>
			<p>The latest version of TrueCrypt, which you should not download because it may not be trustworthy, will no longer allow you to create encrypted Volumes, but it will allow you to continue using them if they exist. TrueCrypt volumes are not to be trusted on their own at this time.<br><br>
			To continue safely using these volumes, use the commands above to encrypt the TrueCrypt volume (with yourself as the "Recipient"). Then, securely delete the original TrueCrypt volume.<br><br>	
			When you need to access the volume, first decrypt it. Then, you can mount the decrypted copy in TrueCrypt like normal. When you are finished, Dismount the TrueCrypt volume.<br><br>
			After dismounting the volume, use the commands above to encrypt the volume with GPG again.<br><br>
			We recommend that you use this method immediately to encrypt any existing TrueCrypt volumes. When you have time, decrypt the volumes and copy the files into a new folder. Compress or zip that folder, then encrypt it using the commands above.<br><br>
			After the transition, you will access your files by first decrypting the zip file with GPG, then unzipping it.</p>
			<p><strong>Please remember to securely delete</strong> any extra file or folder created in this process. When you start or end, you should only have one file and it should end in .gpg (i.e., the encrypted file).<br><br>

			<h3>Encrypt Files to Share</h3>
			<p>If you share files through email, Dropbox, or any other means, you can use these commands to encrypt them first. Just be sure to import your contact's public key into your key manager first, then use their name as the "Recipient" for the encryption command. If you use an auto-syncing service like Dropbox, be sure to move the .gpg file out of your shared folder before decrypting it. Otherwise the decrypted copy will get synced to your account.</p>
