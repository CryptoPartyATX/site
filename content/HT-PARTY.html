       <h1>Throw a CryptoParty</h1>
          <h3><i>The more crypto the better! Throw your own party!</i></h3>
        
        <p>Hosting a Cryptoparty can be an extremely fun and informative way to engage your community in a conversation about how we can protect ourselves against digital surveillance. Cryptoparties teach valuable skills and raise awareness for electronic privacy issues while fostering an open social atmosphere. It is generally recommended that you begin to plan the party at least one month in advance in order to ensure venue availability and sufficient time for planning and advertising.</p>

          
        <h2>Nutshell</h2>
        <p><ol>
        	<li>Find and reserve a venue that will meet your needs. Capacity, Wi-Fi, and food and drink availability are the most important factors.</li>
			<li>Select a topic for the party, and ensure you have someone to present it and others to help your guests with the software.</li>
			<li>Get the word out through flyers, social media, newspapers, and event sites.</li>
			<li>Set a party schedule and ensure you have all the supplies you need.</li>
			<li>Party like it's 1984!</li>
